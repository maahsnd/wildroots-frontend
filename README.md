# Wild Roots

This repo is for the public facing site of Wild Roots Kitchen & Farm: a farm and catering business located on Vashon Island, WA. The menu, farm stand, and farmers
market offerings are updated weekly via a custom built administrative CMS that leverages Google's Firebase to share data between two React applications. This allows the business
owner to update text and images in an easy, convenient manner. The frontend layout was developed in collaboration with the business owner, and takes inspiration
from other local food operations in the area. Responsiveness on mobile devices was a significant point of emphasis during the development process, as many customers
were expected to view the page on their phones. This, paired with my goal of designing an application that could be maintained day-to-day by a self-described 'not
technically oriented' person, proved to be the most challenging, and engaging, pointsof the project.
